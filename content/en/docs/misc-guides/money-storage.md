## Mugging

The cash you have on hand is mug-able meaning someone can attack you and steal it from you so you will want to keep only a small amount that you can afford to lose on your hand. A Mug results in losing 5% to 15% of your cash in hand depending on the muggers merits allocation to "masterful looting" most muggers will have this one maxed or close to max. 

### Mug Protection

If you get mugged then the remaining cash on your hand is immediately protected by "Mug Protection" meaning once you get out of hospital in 35 minutes or so the potentially mug-able amount will be reduced close to 0, this lasts in a linear form for 12 hours after which full amount can be mugged again.   

Mug Protection will be void if you move this protected cash or for any new cash that entered since the last mug, another mug on you will give you mug protection again for any new cash on your hand.

## Cash Storage 

I will list some safe cash storage methods that I personally recommend I will also be ignoring some other methods either because they are unsafe or relatively risky and you shouldn't be doing them. (racing, poker, password-russian-roulette etc)

### Piggy Bank

As a brand new player you will be able to purchase the piggy bank item from your [missions](https://www.torn.com/loader.php?sid=missions) shop for the first 2 weeks, make sure you buy it ASAP it costs only 5 mission credits. Its essentially an unlimited storage bank. 

Breaking the piggy bank will result in all cash inside it moved to your hand, Piggy bank is a one time use item you break it you lose it and you cannot buy it ever again. It is also untrade-able meaning you can't trade it with other players. So ensure you make good use of it in your early days. 

### Ghost Trades

Ghost trades are basically trades set with people that you can trust just to store cash safely, cash in trade cannot be stolen by muggers till it enters your hand.  

Who can you trust? In a crime based game where you are supposed to trust no one, some people that are *somewhat* trustworthy are your faction leaders/members, spouse if your married or a friend that wouldn't rat you. Always remember that they can cancel and mug you so never ghost trade with people you can't trust.

The person you set trade with needs to be online during the last 6 hours and also Trades last for 6 hours total after you initiate them so ensure you set an alarm 10 minutes prior to end time (5 hours 50 minutes) so you can reset it or set it with someone else. 

#### How to set a ghost trade?

1. Visit your friend's profile
2. Click on the trade icon 

![](ghost-trade/trade-icon.png)

3. Enter the reason to ensure that your friend understands that its a ghost trade and he shouldn't be checking it or accepting it. (some of the common reasons are "gh" "ghost" or "cash storage")  

![](ghost-trade/new-trade-scr.png) 

4. Click on the Plus Icon [+] next to "no cash in trade" 

![](ghost-trade/add-cash-btn.png) 

5. type the total cash you wish to add to ghost trade or if its all you can click on the Dollar Icon [$] next to "Money:"

If you wish to remove cash then click on the [+] Icon and enter the amount you wish to keep in trade, rest will be moved to your hand. 

### City Bank

This is the safest option to store cash and it will also grow since the bank provides Interest, As a new player I would suggest investing everything you have except for a small float for day to day expenses, and choose the 7 days or 14 days option. 

Once the Investment period ends the cash will NOT be withdrawn automatically, the cash will remain there indefinitely. you will have to head over to the bank and manually withdraw it and then reinvest again. 

### Cayman Island 

Cayman Island's bank can only be accessed after you hit level 15 and unlock travelling, you can find a level 15 guide [Here](../../prologue/level15) if your not already there. It is great for storing large amounts of cash (5b+) and there's no celing on how much you can store there. 

Moving cash there and back is Extremely RISKY due to players having access to API tools that can track your travel time and send them pings to mug you on arrival or landing. your cash on hand can also be spied by a company special so they will know whether you have cash or not. Thankfully there's a 15 second buffer on landing in torn as well as overseas during which you cannot be attacked so make use of it.

Always set alarms or countdowns to a minute prior to landing so that you can quickly move cash around before the 15 seconds buffer runs out. **Do not rely on third party apps or extensions to ping you**

### Stocks 

Ever since stocks 2.0 was released allowing you to instantly buy and sell them, they have been one of the best ways to store cash, there's a prerequisite though, you will need to buy a stock ticker from the [Points Building](https://www.torn.com/points.php) 

There's no limit on storage but it comes with the **huge risk of price fluctuation**, good for short term storage. Colaman32 has a fantastic [sheet guide](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=61&t=16224439) for buying stocks. I would personally suggest throwing money into the first or second stock that shows up on his sheet since they will have good ROI and you will be buying them in the future anyways, might as well buy smaller chunks early.   

### Points

Points are a good option to store cash, you can buy them from City -> [Points Market](https://torn.com/pmarket.php) and then sell them at a small loss to [pawn shop](https://www.torn.com/shops.php?step=pawnshop) or also in the Points Market but remember that **people can buy and mug you** so it is not recommended unless your good at protection yourself by self hosping or travelling. 

There is also reverse sell mug in which the sellers of points mugs you right after you buy their points so always ensure that you use [ghost trades](#ghost-trades) to move cash and only keep in hand what is required for the purchase. 

### Items 

Please beaware of sell mug see the end statement over at [Points](#points)
Some good to items to store cash are:- 

1. Xanax - most traders pay close to market and they hold up value nicely
2. Donator Packs - DPs are known to hold value really well and they can be Instantly sold to Pawn Shop. look at "Sell" under item info 

![](ghost-trade/dp-price.png) 
3. Temp Items - Grenades, HEGs can be instantly sold for 7k and 15k each to the NPC shops
4. Type 98 Anti Tank - they sell close to 17M in market and can be instantly sold to NPC shops for 17M

### Property Vaults 

Palaces, Castles and Islands can be upgraded with Vaults to enable you to store cash, the requirement is that you should be owning them, you cannot access vaults of rented properties. There are 4 types of vaults 

1. Small costs 20m and holds 100M
2. Medium costs 42M and holds 300M
3. Large costs 98M and holds 500M
4. XL costs 215M and holds 1B

### Faction Vault 

Most factions will let you to store cash in faction. Only store cash in faction if you trust the leaders to not scam you. you can deposit unlimited but I would suggest depositing less than 5B and anything over move them to caymans. Only leaders and members with vault access can give you your money. you need to have okay status to deposit into faction. Faction vaults are great for short term storage. 

### Company Vaults 

If your a director you can store cash in company vault, please remember that there's a company special that lets others steal (hack) upto 3% from the company bank so ensure you store only smaller amounts like 2B. SYS Benefit block is a must if you want to store unlimited cash in company (makes the company unhack-able). 

## Winning the lottery / Slots / Big Money Quick Storage

Congrats! you've won the lottery! what do you do now? I originally posted this in a forum thread thought I'd re-do it and add to this guide section. 

People are gonna be on you like vultures now, any move you make they will see and any money you have they will attempt to mug. Apart from being mugged people will try very hard to swindle you, for example someone will try to sell you a maxed private island or tell you that a 2000 island is a maxed island and attempt to sell it to you for 2b/3b, people will spam message you begging for money, some will try to intimidate you. **IGNORE, ALL OF THEM. Keep your head clear cause if you invest this money carefully you'd be set for life.**

### Slots Win

TORN TORN TORN, these 3 words are gonna change your life, the moment you see this you are in danger, quickly head over to stocks page and dump it ALL IN, yes ALL IN a single stock.

Ghost trading may not be viable due to the time it takes to set-up and your brain will pretty much be in shock so dropping all into a single stock is your best option, sure it might go down and you might lose a small % or heck it might actually go up eitherway its better than losing upto 15% of your winning to a single mugger. Read [Investing your winnings](#investing-your-winnings) now.

### Lottery Win 

Lottery money is disbursed via cashiers cheque which can be claimed from the bank at anytime but some clown is gonna mug you just cause they saw the event from lottery that you've won and plenty others are gonna keep mugging you just trying their luck so its extremely important that you have fast fingers and also that you let it sit there in the bank for few hours first. 

Once things relatively cooldown claim that cheque from bank then use [ghost trades](#ghost-trades) temporarily to store it

While I would personally not recommend, if you got acccess to [sports shop](https://www.torn.com/shops.php?step=nikeh) buy up Dumbbells or Boxing Gloves, only these 2 since they are easy to resell to a trusted trader for close to shop buy price. 

### Investing your winnings

Drop 2b into bank, then start buying the benefit blocks. use [Cola's Sheet](#stocks) make sure that you only keep as much cash as required on hand always use ghost trade or only sell as much stock as required for the blocks. Give yourself some time to process, its only pixel money sure but don't go around throwing it all away lol. 

Good luck!
