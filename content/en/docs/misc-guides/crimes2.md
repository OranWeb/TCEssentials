Never thought I'd be writing this guide but here we go, after ages Crimes 2.0 Beta was released on 20th june 2023, It is the 2nd version of the crime mechanics in torn, you can do crimes to earn cash, items and alongside gain crime skill to level up the particular crime and crime experience.

**Crimes 2.0 is completely different from Crimes 1.0 in every way possible. Note: This guide is still work in progress and might have inaccurate/incomplete information till more info is discovered and publicly posted by players.**

## To migrate or not to migrate that is the question

Older players are presented with the choice to stay with Crimes 1.0 or migrate to 2.0 but you cannot do both at the same time, and also once you choose to migrate there's no way to go back. Please Read the announcement [here](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=1&t=16337792&b=0&a=0) before you migrate.

some things to keep in mind before you press the shiny button in the onboarding screen:

1. There is only a single crime available right now, with newer crimes being released every 2 to 3 weeks.
2. Arson warehouse from Crimes 1.0 is STILL the best way to gain the most amount of CE.
3. There's no guaranteed Hosp result crime in 2.0 as of yet. So do not migrate if you need that particular crime.
4. Crimes 2.0 is super fun and has unique outcomes which alone makes it worth Migrating. A lot of attention to details have been given by the developers to every single aspect of crimes 2.0.
5. By staying back in the older system you will lose an advantage in completing crime Skill/levels before everyone else.

So the takeaway, If you want to farm CE with arsons or self hosp with Kidnap Cop Crime then DO NOT ~~REDEEM~~ MIGRATE.

## Crimes 2.0 User Interface

The UI of crimes 2.0 is quite simple, there's a crime and then sub crimes inside it, for example search for cash is the crime and inside search for cash there's
Search the Trash or Search the Subway as subcrimes.

![success percent displayed in tooltip](https://i.oran.pw/images/VW32k.png)

![](https://i.oran.pw/images/ueiNi.png)

Always hover over the tooltip to view success rate and do the crimes with highest success rate.

![](https://i.oran.pw/images/NRHYi.png)

You can click on the image at the top of the sub crimes to display statistics for the particular crime, search for cash for example displays items found, cash earned, success progression which is basically just faction perks + merits in crime progression + bonuses from education + bonuses from company + Enhancer items.

_- Some crimes have Unique Outcomes that can only ever be received once. Little stars will appear at the bottom of the attempt buttons to indicate any Unique Outcomes that are currently available to you. These outcomes may provide more lucrative rewards, or they may provide special items. Unique Outcomes provide bonus skill and experience._

So now you might wonder, which crime you should be attempting?

Due to crimes being time gated my personal suggestion is to attempt anything above 80%+ chance regularly and 65%+ if it has the unique stars or there's a lack of 80%+ crimes available. If all crimes have low success chance when you've logged in it might make sense to spam maybe 5 relatively easy ones so the nerve regerates and save up remaining of your nerve for later.

## Search for cash

![ search for cash sub crimes](https://i.oran.pw/images/rZr4r.png)

![](https://i.oran.pw/images/NRHYi.png)

There are 6 sub crimes for search for cash crime with various time related success rates.

### Search the Trash

Search the trash has the lowest chance of success every Monday's 06:00 - 18:00 TCT which is refered to as "trash collection"

The best time to attempt this crime is later during the week and weekends with Sunday's having the higest chance of success.

### Search the Subway

Subway crime success rate is based on users online in the last hour, see [thread](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=2&t=16338383)

![](https://i.imgur.com/d6HvGsi.png)

So this is the best crime to attempt between 14 - 20 tct the usual time when US players activity coincides with EU and Asian players. It will be interesting to see how this particular crime handles downtime and high activity events like Halloween.

One of the unique outcome is finding the Lost and found office key which "unlocks additional outcomes" for subway crime. screenshots by pagey

### Search the Junkyard

Another weekly time gated crime, has highest success rate between weekends and tuesday then gradually drops with small spurs here and there between wednesday and saturday.

Once you've reached level 30 in crime skill a 'unique' star will appear on the search button for this crime, You will easily find a metal detector which is the item required for the next crime. You can only find it once but it is a guaranteed find also if you sell the metal detector you will have to purchase it later to attempt search the beach crime.

_note: 50% of the info was confirmed by bogie via private communication to the wiki team and the remaining 50% was confirmed by my me finding a metal detector as soon as my dumbass hit level 30 in crime skill._

### Search the Beach

So you thought subway crime was interesting, wait till you find out how this shit works

_The system generates a percentage representing the current tide level based on the current time. It approximates tidal patterns using the major celestial influences on Earth's tides, including the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun, Earth's rotation, and its axial tilt. The model uses a sinusoidal function to simulate the regular rise and fall of the tides due to the lunar day, adjusted for the effects of the solar day and the annual cycle. The model also accounts for variations in the lunar phase, altering the lunar contribution to the tide level to simulate spring and neap tides._

- chedburn on bug report that said [tides were not tiding](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=2&t=16338098&b=0&a=0)

So when is the best time to do this crime? accoridng to Kafia on the same thread

_For one week a month, there will be low tides (close to 100% chance of success) at near to 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00 hours (or between those hours, not sure)_

After level 50 you will find a 'Cementary Key' which is an item required for the next crime.

### Search the Cemetery

Another weekly time gated crime that requires 'Cementary Key' item to access.

It has Highest success rate during the weekend and lowest during weekdays between 9 and 17 TCT. What sets this crime apart from the rest is the low chance to rob the grave of the old loan shark Tomothy 'Tim' which earns you 100k+ screenshot below by [Pagey](https://www.torn.com/profiles.php?XID=2129946)

### Search the Fountain

The final crime from search for cash, fountain requires you to have 75 crime skill in search for cash to access

It has the lowest success rate during the first week gradually decreasing during the month with the highest success rate during the 4th week of the month. screenshot by pagey.

![](https://i.oran.pw/images/dD73h.png)

Search the fountain also gives you different colored spray cans which are _probably_ usable for future crimes (vandalism)
