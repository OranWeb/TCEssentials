If you're a new player looking for a faction, it's important to find a good fit. When I started playing, I made the mistake of applying to higher-end factions that were meant for high-stat players, and I felt lost and discouraged when I didn't get accepted. To avoid this, take a look at the list below and message the faction leaders if you're interested in joining their faction. Make sure to read their requirements carefully and make sure you can keep up.

If you're a faction leader that takes in newer players, please send me a chat or mail with your requirements, and I'll add you to the list. Note that there are certain requirements to be added to this list to ensure that new players join the right faction.

This guide was originally posted on the forums, and I had allowed faction leaders to write whatever they wanted and that ended up being misused. Therefore, this time I will be writing for them based on my chat with the leaders and my personal experience of judging the faction members currently inside. The list is arranged in order of addition.

## [NPO - Valour](https://www.torn.com/factions.php?step=profile&ID=14052#/)

NPO used to be an offsite community but ever since they've joined Torn they're very active and have a growing discord community. they provide weapon/armors for use and Xanax/Points for wars/chains. I have first hand seen their Coordination skills. If you're not willing to learn and be active, play fast paced this faction may not be for you.

## WTF Family

WTF is a 3 faction family lead by some of the most experienced leaders they will at the moment accept new players, their discord is also very active. They provide their own guides to help members grow. WTF requires you to be an active player and you are given 2 weeks to reach level 15. They also have their own set of rules failing to abide by will result in a kick.

TORNado was part of the original guide and players that joined them have only told me positive things. TORNado is not _very_ fast paced but they are active and they will require you to be very active during their territory wars.

## [We Are Rising ](https://www.torn.com/factions.php?step=profile&ID=15046#/)

We are Rising or WAR was one of the first faction to be run for new player development and they had quick growth over the years. They have good faction specials and some roleplaying stuff if you're into that I personally did not understand any of that. They require you to be active and follow all Instructions.

Leviathan Initiative is a training + chaining hybrid faction that pride themselves in being a family, who work together, genuinely care about each other, and have fun while they play, all while warring and kicking ass. They are looking for like-minded individuals who want to War, Chain, Grow, and have fun while doing it. LVI is not a casual style faction, so if that is what you are looking for, this may not be the right one for you. They are accepting both new and returning players.
