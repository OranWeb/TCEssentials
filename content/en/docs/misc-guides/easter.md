You can find the easter week in the calendar, basically it runs after good friday, my dumbass had a date listed here cause you know... I forgot that the dates change every year. There have been a few changes, such as the fact that eggs no longer disappear from the page and can be picked up at any time during the event. Additionally, the eggs have been made 2x bigger.

If that is not enough, you can install the two scripts linked below and collect the eggs in easy mode. you will need a script manager such as [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/)

[Heasley's Egg Navigator - Visit every page on Torn](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=67&t=16326854&b=0&a=0)

[Egg Finder](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=67&t=16326456&b=0&a=0)

The first script creates a button on the sidebar to cycle through pages, while the second script generates JavaScript alerts each time an egg is detected on a page. It also makes the egg 4x larger and throws a comically red rectangle, as if it's straight out of a cringe YouTube video.

Both scripts are safe to use and have been confirmed not to cause any negative effects on the egg spawn rate, as it is equal for all players.

## How Often should I run through pages

once every 12 or 24 hours and a final run before the event ends since eggs don't spawn on the last day of the event this day is for pickup only.

## How do I use scripts on Mobile Devices

Install the TORN PDA [App](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=67&t=16163503&b=0&a=0) (incredibly useful app) It is available for both Android and iOS devices.

After setting up the App, click on the hamburger menu located at the top left of the screen, then click on 'Settings' Next, click on 'Advanced Browser Settings' scroll down to the 'Userscripts' section, and click on 'Manage scripts.' Click on the plus icon, then enter the script name and copy and paste the scripts one at a time and add them.

## Eggs Usage Guide

Cornhub has a Guide [here](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=61&t=16325282&b=0&a=0)

Good Luck!
