## Welcome

Welcome to Torn City! Before we begin, it's important to note that Torn is a long-term game that doesn't have an "end" or a finish line. Instead, it offers a form of delayed gratification that may seem unusual at first but is what makes the game enjoyable and unique. While there is no instant gratification, the game provides a satisfying sense of accomplishment over time. So, get ready for a rewarding journey in Torn City!

Torn is a completely free-to-play game with virtually no pay-to-win elements. You won't find any in-app purchases to refill a particular stat for $9.99 or buy "1x Levels" for $24.99. Chedburn, the administrator, has proven time and time again that milking the players is not their goal, and it never will be in the future. The best part? **There are absolutely no advertisements in the game!**

Most people in Torn are friendly, but like every other game, there are the "nice bunch" and the "horrible bunch." As long as you don't go looking for trouble, you should be fine. However, it's important to note that scamming is legal in the game, so you should be careful about who you trust.

You may have read about Torn being a "criminal game" with the ability to attack people on the advertisements or homepage. While it's true that you can do all of that, as a new player, you will be extremely weak compared to those who have been playing for ages. Therefore, it's better to keep your head down at the start and work on building up your battle stats to get stronger, making good friends, helping your faction in wars, and having fun. While the criminal aspect of the game can be thrilling, it's important to approach it with caution and build your strength gradually.

### Donator Status

Donator Status is an important feature in Torn as it helps to regenerate energy 50% faster and increases your energy maximum to 150, among many other perks. Most factions will require you to have or work towards getting Donator Status. There are also merits and medals associated with it, which can give you a significant advantage in the game. Therefore, it's recommended that you consider obtaining Donator Status to enhance your gaming experience.

If you wish to support the game with real money 

1. Buy a Subscription for $4.85 Per month (or 48.50 Annually)

Subscribing will automatically credit you with 31 Donator Days, along with a few other minor goodies, and also enters you into a lottery to win up to 10,000 points! Keep in mind that a subscription is recurring and cannot be resold for in-game cash. If you can afford it, you should consider subscribing, as it also comes with a chance to receive books every month. These books can provide you with a significant boost early or late in the game if used wisely.

2. Buy a Donator Pack for $5 

Donator Pack can be used to gain Donator Status (31 Days per pack) or If you wish to, you can buy multiple of these then use 1 and Resell the rest in the Item Market, Bazaar, [Pawn Shop](https://www.torn.com/shops.php?step=pawnshop) or to a Trusted Trader for ~22.5M in-game Money. 

As such you can buy a Donator Pack from other players in the [Item market](https://www.torn.com/imarket.php#/p=market&cat=supply-packs). It is recommended that you grind to buy Donator Packs and always be under Donator Status.
