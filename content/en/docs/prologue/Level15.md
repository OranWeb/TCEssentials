## The Magic Number 

Level 15 is where your gameplay truly expands and enables you earn significant amount of money as well as rehab in switzerland to remove drug addiction, thats why its always highly recommended that you grind towards hitting level 15 in your early days. Once your there you could do your own thing choose to hold or just keep going. There are advantages to levelling up, like you gain more max health and also there are merits to be collected on the way. 

As a newbie it might seem very hard to level up, don't worry this guide has your back! You gain levels by gaining experience, every action you make in Torn gives you a tiny bit of experience, by far the biggest source is attacking and leaving a 'levelling target' 

## Levelling Targets 

Levelling targets are accounts that have been abandoned, are of high levels and also have low stats. There are a few lists of them on the forums, I will be direct linking them somewhere below on this page.  

## Initial Preparation 

*Note: I am listing cheap stuff here, you can buy the more expensive stuff if you can afford to. (that would be Diamond bladed knife and full combat set)*

You will need to train your battle stats in the gym to a certain amount first this could take you anywhere from a day to a whole week, you will also need to buy a decent weapon either from Bits & Bobs or a Macana from Item Market they cost like 100k and are worth it. We are going to skip on a gun for now. 

For armor grab a full body armor (60k), a Leather or Construction Helmet, Leather Gloves, Leather Pants and Leather boots once you've bought them goto your items page and make sure you equip them. I will also suggest buying like 200 Pepper Sprays from either big al's or from the item market these are under the temporary items section (head over to [settings](https://www.torn.com/preferences.php#tab=attack-preferences) and enable re-equip after fight for temporary items.)

## The Housing Situation

You will need to rent and move into a better house anything from a Palace to a Island whatever you can afford to rent, this is only temporary for you to train 7 days rental is most likely enough, you will be renting an island later anyways so go for something cheap with less days on the [rental market](https://www.torn.com/properties.php?step=rentalmarket#/). 

## Getting your happy up

Once you've moved in to a better house you will notice your happy hasn't gone to up to max or that it will go up very slowly, there's an easy method to bring your happy up, head over to [Sally's Sweet Shop](https://www.torn.com/shops.php?step=candy) and buy 100 of lollipops if there are none of those then buy Bag of Chocolate Kisses. Candies can also be bought on the [item market](https://www.torn.com/imarket.php#/p=market&cat=candy) if you're willing to pay a bit more for them. 

After procuring the candies head over to the Item Market and buy an [Ecstasy](https://www.torn.com/imarket.php#/p=market&cat=drugs), Ecstasy is a drug that will double your happiness on usage. 

Now that you have all the training supplies you need, use as many lollipops as you can (they add booster cooldown) then once it says you've run out of booster cooldown use the ecstasy (ecstasy adds drug cooldown) this will double your current happiness. Head over to the gym and train your stats

My personal recommendation is to get your Strength, Defense and Speed to atleast 500 each, but more is better before you start hitting the [levelling targets](#levelling-targets) If you're able to defeat any of them before you hit 500 stats each then sure go for it don't forget to add them to your friends/enemies list with a note (levelling target easy/medium/hard) so you can find them with ease again to continue farming xp from them.  

## The Lists of Levelling Targets 

There are variety of lists with decent levelling targets, one of the most popular is run by baldr on his basic advice guide and he does a fantastic job at it, which is why I have not compiled a list but rather I direct link to his list on his fantastic guide. 

[Baldr's Levelling Targets](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=61&t=16034448&to=18301173) - there are 3 lists here all low statters 

Triplicant also has a list [here](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&f=61&t=16070031) but its no longer updated due to his passing irl. If baldr's targets are all hospitalized then go through some on this one. 

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Pro Tip: you can click and hold on the target's name to see their hospital/okay status." />}}

## Attacking the Levelling Targets 

Make sure your Weapons and Armors are equipped first from the Items page, don't forget to equip the temporary item and set it to re-equip after use from the [attack settings preferences panel](https://www.torn.com/preferences.php#tab=attack-preferences). Its an easy mistake to make, to forget to equip items and join an attack naked. 

After clicking on start attack button you will have 5 minutes/25 turns to finish the attack after which it will stalemate or result in a loss. So make sure you keep that in mind. 

Use the temporary item (pepper spray) first so that the targets dexterity gets reduced to one fifth for 20 seconds, then spam click on the melee weapon. If you manage to defeat them you get 3 options, Leave Mug or Hospitalize **Always click on Leave since it gives the most XP.** 

Keep attacking the levelling targets on the regular, you can use LSD which is cheap and gives 50 energy or Xanax which gives 250 energy to gain additional energy to spend on attacking. If you can afford to, consider using an [energy refill](https://www.torn.com/points.php) for 25 points make sure your energy is at 0 first since refill only refills your energy to max it doesn't add on top to it. 

It takes anywhere from 120 to 200 attacks to hit level 15 so it will feel like a grind but its definitely worth it. 

Once you've hit Level 15 you can read [this guide](../after15) for next steps.
