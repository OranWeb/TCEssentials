**TLDR**: Analytics on TC-Essentials is powered by GA4

### Information we collect and what we use it for

Cloudflare is only used to manage DNS on non-proxy mode. Please read their [Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/)

TC Essentialls is hosted on Netlify. Netlify offers a paid analytics plan for 9 bucks per month and I'm not paying for it, Previously I had self hosted plausible analytics running which is privacy friendly and collected bare minimum data on visitors, however I've run into issues with it and its been down since January taking down all the analytics of other sites i run along with it.

Now after almost 2 months of dealing with other analytics tools i have little to no option but to use google analytics. GA4 is highly intrusive and collects god knows what about users. It will profile you and collect things, These can include things like your device screen size (platform), site from where you came to a page here, Browser string, the amount of time you spend on this site on a particular page, the country from where you are accessing this site, click events, scroll data and much much more.

Google then uses this collected data to intrude you with "Personalized" advertisements on other sites.
If you're aware of any privacy friendly analytics tool that can semi-accurately display like 4 things - page views, unique visitors, device and country please let me know.

No API Keys or User Details including passwords, usernames etc are collected, like bruh tis jus a static website on the interwebs we aint gonna ask you for your mothers maiden name or someth.
